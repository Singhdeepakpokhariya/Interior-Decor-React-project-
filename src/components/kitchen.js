                        <p>Planning is an integral part of interior design. Space  <br/> planning begins at the architectural level. If you want a  <br/> room to be of a specific size it has to be built with  <br/> those dimensions. To change the room size of  <br/> an existing structure it would require structural  <br/> modifications to the interiors.</p>
